# Cloudcrowd - Just In Time hail and storm alerts

"The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a storm warning for heavy rains and damaging hail" - words we hear with it seems increasing frequency.   But what can you do?  Panic?   Head for the hills?   Ignore?     Nine times out of ten nothing happens in your street, but you later hear about "hailstones the size of wombats" on just the other side of town.  It's in the nature of, well, Nature, to be random.     

What we'd like (especially here in Brisbane, famous for its spring-summer hailstorms) is hyperlocal alerts of incoming nasties.    If you knew that hail was hitting your neighbours in the next suburb, that might be all the warning you need to get off the road, cover your valuables, or rescue your washing and pets.

So let's make it happen.    If a just few homes in each suburb had an internet-connected hail and flooding-rain detector, the path of damaging hail fronts could be predicted in real time, with fewer false alarms.

In the Brisbane Internet of Things Interest group (find us on meetup.com) we're building this solution.     A solar panel that doubles as a hailstone detector, vibration sensor to measure the hail, a rain gauge and lets throw in barometric pressure, humidity and temperature because why not.     We'll leverage the existing community LoRaWAN network, but also provide a reference design for a Linux-powered LoRa base station if your area is not covered.
